## a bit about me
{: style="text-align: center;"}

My name is Carl-Philip Majgaard. I come from Denmark, grew up in Poland, speak five languages, and go to school at Colby College in Maine, where I study Computer Science as an Oak Foundation Scholar.

My major interests include machine learning, networking, entrepreneurship, and writing beautiful code. Oh, and dogs! <sub> I heckin love doggos</sub>

I decided to spin up this blog to chronicle whatever I'm diving head first into at the given moment. Expect to see some machine learning, fun hacks, and a few thoughts of mine every once in a while.


<h2>some of my skills</h2>
* Java, JavaEE
* Python
* Javascript, AngularJS
* CSS, LESS
* Node.js
* Django
* Tensorflow
* PostgreSQL, JPQL
* Git
